# Scheduled App - Beta Testing Plan

## Overview
3-month beta testing program across multiple industries with strategic feedback collection to optimize product-market fit before full launch.

## Beta Testing Schedule

### Duration: 3 Months
**Target Industries:**
- Beauty & Wellness (salons, spas, massage therapy)
- Home Services (contractors, plumbers, electricians)
- Pet Care (groomers, sitters, daycare)
- Creative Services (photographers, designers)

## Survey Strategy

### Monthly Surveys (4 questions maximum)
**Timing:** First Monday of each month
**Duration:** Under 2 minutes to complete
**Response Method:** Email survey + optional in-app prompts

### Month 1 - Core Functionality & First Impressions
1. Which feature saves you the most time in your daily operations?
2. What's the biggest pain point you still face that the app doesn't solve?
3. How would you rate the appointment booking flow for your customers? (1-10 + why)
4. What would make you recommend this app to another business owner?

### Month 2 - Business Impact & Usage Patterns  
1. How has the app affected your weekly revenue? (increase/decrease/same + estimate)
2. Which industry-specific features do you use most? Which do you ignore?
3. How often do your customers use the direct booking links vs calling you?
4. What's missing that would make this a "must-have" instead of "nice-to-have"?

### Month 3 - Pricing & Long-term Value
1. Based on 3 months of use, what would you pay monthly for this app? ($25/$75/$199/more)
2. What would cause you to cancel your subscription?
3. Which feature should we prioritize building next?
4. Would you switch from your current system to this app permanently? (why/why not)
