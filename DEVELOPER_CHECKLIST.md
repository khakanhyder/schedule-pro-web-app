## Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Create new client through UI
- [ ] Book appointment for client
- [ ] Send review request (should receive real email)
- [ ] Process payment (test mode)
- [ ] Generate business reports
- [ ] Test mobile responsive design

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle duplicate appointments
- [ ] Validate email addresses
- [ ] Test with large client lists (100+ clients)
- [ ] Verify timezone handling
- [ ] Test offline functionality

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Technical
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] Database schema pushed: `npm run db:push`
- [ ] Email system verified with real domain
- [ ] Payment processing tested
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive

### Business
- [ ] All user flows tested end-to-end
- [ ] iOS app builds successfully
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Backup procedures in place

## Code Quality Standards

### Required Patterns
- [ ] Use existing UI components from `components/ui/`
- [ ] Follow TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Use React Query for API calls
- [ ] Follow established file structure

### Performance
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with useCallback/useMemo
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Email Not Sending
- Check console logs for Resend API responses
- Verify email address format
- Ensure RESEND_API_KEY is set
- For production: verify domain at resend.com

### Database Errors
- Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema
- Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Use `npm run db:studio` to inspect data
- Verify schema.ts matches storage.ts interface

### iOS Build Issues
- Ensure Xcode is installed and updated
- Run `npx cap sync ios` after changes
- Check iOS simulator for console errors
- Verify Capacitor configuration

## Delivery Expectations

### Minimum Viable Delivery
- All existing features continue working
- Basic UI improvements implemented
- No breaking changes to API
- Code follows established patterns

### Ideal Delivery
- iOS app ready for App Store submission
- Production deployment configured
- Performance optimized
- Comprehensive testing completed

## Time Estimates

### For $1,025 Budget
- Focus on Quick Wins section
- Basic UI/UX improvements
- Simple feature additions
- Expected: 10-15 hours

### For $2,000 Budget
- Complete Quick Wins + Medium Tasks
- iOS App Store preparation
- Production deployment setup
- Expected: 20-30 hours

## Final Notes

This codebase is well-structured and feature-complete. The goal is to polish and prepare for production, not rebuild from scratch. Most complex business logic is already implemented and tested.

Success is measured by:
1. Maintaining all existing functionality
2. Adding polish and professional touches
3. Preparing for real business deployment
4. Following established code patterns

The platform is already generating value - the developer's job is to make it production-ready and polished for the target market.
