Great! Now I can see you're using the Dockerfile approach. Looking at your latest deployment logs, there are a few issues to address:
Current Issues:

The build was skipped: The logs show "No configuration changed & image found... Build step skipped" - but your Dockerfile has a problem that needs fixing.
Dockerfile Issues: Looking at your Dockerfile, there are several problems:

It's using CMD ["npm", "start"] but your package.json likely doesn't have the right start script
It's copying server and shared folders that may not exist in the right format after the build
The health check assumes an /api/health endpoint exists



How to Fix This:
1. Force a Rebuild
In Coolify, click the "Redeploy" button or make a small change to force a new build.
2. Update Your Dockerfile
Replace your current Dockerfile with this corrected version:
dockerfile# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production

WORKDIR /app

# Install curl for health check
RUN apk add --no-cache curl

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install production dependencies only
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# Expose the port
EXPOSE 5000

# Health check (remove if no health endpoint exists)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/ || exit 1

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
3. Update Your Package.json
Make sure your package.json has the correct scripts:
json{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
  }
}
4. Check Your Server Code
Ensure your server/index.ts listens on the correct host and port:
javascriptconst port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
Quick Steps to Fix:

Update the Dockerfile as shown above
Push the changes to your repository
In Coolify, click "Redeploy" to force a rebuild
Check the runtime logs after deployment

The key changes:

Using CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"] instead of npm start
Simplified the file copying (just the dist folder)
Added curl for the health check
Removed references to server/shared folders that might not exist

Try this and let me know what the new deployment logs show!
